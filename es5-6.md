# ES5 & ES6

* ES5 — The old JavaScript version that is supported by all modern web browsers.
* ES6 — The current JavaScript version that is not supported by all modern web browsers. The syntax is more readable, similar to other programming languages, and addresses the source of common bugs in ES5. 
* [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) — a website you can use to look up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript browser compatibility information.
* Babel — A JavaScript package that transpiles JavaScript ES6+ code to ES5 so it can work in modern browsers that don't have ES6 support yet.


## New features in ES6

Some of the new features in ES6:

* JavaScript Arrow Functions - see below
* JavaScript `let` - defines a variable with block scope
* JavaScript `const` - defines a variable with a constant value
* JavaScript Classes (see [instantiation](instantiation.md))
* Default parameter values - defines a fallback if a function call doesn't include a required argument
* Array.find() - lets you search through an Array, returns the matched value 
* Array.findIndex() - like Array.find but returns the index number instead of the value
* Exponent operator _(EcmaScript 2016)_ - `5 ** 2 // ==> 25`

### Arrow Functions
```javascript
// ES5
var x = function(x, y) {
   return x * y;
}

// ES6
const x = (x, y) => x * y;

---

hello = () => "Hello World!";
// returns value by default

hello = (a) => "Hello " + a;
hello = a => "Hello " + a;
// with a paramater; if there is only one parameter then no parentheses are needed
```
* Arrow functions __should not__ be used to define Object methods.
