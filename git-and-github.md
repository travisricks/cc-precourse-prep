# Git and GitHub

## Git
Git is an open source version control system. It's a distributed system which means every developer's copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full change history of the code. Many services host Git repositories, with __GitHub__ probably being the most popular. 

## GitHub
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It has [features](https://github.com/features) for team collaboration, issue and bug tracking, deployment releases, and many more.
