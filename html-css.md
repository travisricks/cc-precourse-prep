# HTML & CSS
In my last job, I worked on a team that built websites for student media organizations. I had experiences in both the design of these sites as well as the development.

During this time, some of the technologies I used were:

* HTML & CSS
* Twitter's Bootstrap framework
* LESS and SASS
* Twig templating language
* Working with SQL and Mongo databases

Here are a few websites I was a part of:

* <a href="https://statenews.com/" target="_blank">The State News</a>
* <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/" target="_blank">IDS News</a>
* <a href="https://www.mndaily.com/" target="_blank">Minnesota Daily</a>

Outside of work, I also built a few projects for class work. This included using some data visualization tools, Highcharts and Tableau, as well as shooting and editing videos.
