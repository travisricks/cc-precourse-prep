# Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. This means you can use Node.js for things besides interacting with websites.

One important feature of node is that it is asynchronous (non-blocking I/O). This means it can handle many requests more quickly and efficiently than a synchronous (blocking) program.

A formal definition from the official Node.js website:
* Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
* Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
* Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

There are 5 main things people use Node.js for.

1. Package management through npm, bower, jspm, etc.
1. Development tooling (module management with webpack, task running and automation through grunt or gulp, linters like eslint or jslint, etc.)
1. Creation of back-end web applications.
1. Command line tools like rimraf.
1. Desktop applications.
