# Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. This means you can use Node.js for things besides interacting with websites.

One important feature of node is that it is asynchronous (non-blocking I/O). This means it can handle many requests more quickly and efficiently than a synchronous (blocking) program.
